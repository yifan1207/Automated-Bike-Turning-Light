# Automated-Bike-Turning-Light
An automated turning detection and display system for bikes.
In daily life, bicycles are a common means of transportation for people. Since bicycles do not have Turning Lights often found in motor vehicles, it is diﬃcult to inform nearby pedestrian vehicles when turning and changing travel speed, so traﬃc accidents can easily occur in such situations. As an avid cyclist myself, I designed a bicycle steering alert system is developed for the scenario of bicycle steering. 
The device is mainly controlled by Arduino, and with the help of Bluetooth wireless transmission technology, the steering and auxiliary data collected by the upper computer, such as steering instructions, speed, and driving intentions, are sent to the lower computer for processing. The steering information is then displayed on a high-powered LED digital dot matrix screen, and the steering information is prompted by a voice announcement device.
